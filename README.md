# AI for Disaster Management
Dedicated repository for RnD team of AI for Disaster Management.

Considering the challenges and issues of current methods, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for fire monitoring is gaining more traction in recent years. UAVs offer new features and convenience including fast deployment, high maneuverability, wider and adjustable view points. Also, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence especially image-based modeling and analysis we consider AI-powered UAVs can potentially provide extraordinary results.

We, Indonesia AI in collaboration with OMDENA, are now progressing on building AI solution for powering drones in disaster relief scenarios and operations such as wildfires to facilitate early fire detection before a catastrophic event happens. We are working AI project to build, to optimize and to deploy the winning model, which we intend to open source for the scientific community to help combat forest fires in Indonesia so we can build a better Indonesia for generations to come.
